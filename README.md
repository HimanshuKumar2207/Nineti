Libraries:
•	WiFi.h: For WiFi connectivity.
•	BLEDevice.h, BLEUtils.h, BLEServer.h: For BLE functionality.

ESP-IDF:
ESP-IDF stands for Espressif IoT Development Framework, and it is the official development framework for Espressif Systems' chips, particularly the ESP32 and ESP8266 series. It provides the necessary software libraries, tools, and APIs to create applications that run on Espressif's microcontrollers.

In other words we can say that, ESP-IDF is the official framework for developing applications on ESP32 and ESP8266 chips. It provides low-level control over hardware resources, support for FreeRTOS, and a rich set of libraries for IoT development, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HTTP, MQTT, and more. It is ideal for developers who want to build powerful, custom, and performance-optimized applications on Espressif hardware.
Key Features of ESP-IDF:
1.	Comprehensive Development Environment:
o	ESP-IDF provides an integrated environment for developing applications with full access to the ESP32's hardware, such as Bluetooth (Classic and BLE), Wi-Fi, GPIOs, ADCs, timers, and other peripherals.
o	It includes support for real-time operating system (RTOS) (FreeRTOS is used internally), which allows for task management, inter-process communication, and scheduling.
2.	Cross-Platform:
o	It works on various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it versatile for developers working on different platforms.
3.	Low-Level Access:
o	ESP-IDF gives developers direct, low-level access to the ESP32's hardware features (e.g., memory, timers, and peripheral control), which is useful for advanced applications requiring fine control over hardware resources.
4.	High-Level APIs:
o	The framework provides high-level APIs for tasks like Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), HTTP server, MQTT, and more. This makes it easy for developers to quickly build IoT applications without needing to dive deep into hardware details.
5.	Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Stack:
o	ESP-IDF includes a complete Wi-Fi stack for connecting ESP32 to Wi-Fi networks and supports both Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stacks, enabling a wide range of wireless communication options.
6.	FreeRTOS Integration:
o	At the core of ESP-IDF is FreeRTOS, which is an open-source real-time operating system. This gives developers access to multi-threading, semaphore management, timers, and more, providing the capability to design complex systems with multiple tasks running in parallel.
7.	OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates:
o	ESP-IDF supports OTA firmware updates, enabling applications to update their firmware over-the-air without requiring physical access to the device. This is critical for remote IoT devices.
8.	Debugger and Logging:
o	ESP-IDF provides logging facilities (using ESP_LOG macros) for debugging applications and keeping track of runtime behavior. It also supports debugging with GDB and various IDEs.
9.	Development Tools:
o	ESP-IDF includes command-line tools such as idf.py, which is used for building, flashing, and monitoring ESP32 devices.
o	The framework also integrates with popular IDEs such as VS Code and Eclipse, although the development process is largely driven from the command line.
